      <h3>Focus</h3>

      <p>For seven years now we’ve worked to build a pioneering sales and distribution organization that can challenge the “status quo”, break the ingrained paradigms, and provide for greater customer service and consumer choice. With compounded growth now exceeding 35%, we’re there.  We’re ready to work with you to move your brands forward in this challenging environment, both now and into the future.</p>

      <h4 class="center">Our short history of success includes attaining leadership in the:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><p class="center"><span class="uppercase underline">Light Beer Category</span></p></li>
        <li><p class="center"><span class="uppercase underline">Import Beer Category</span></p></li>
        <li><p class="center"><span class="uppercase underline">Specialty and Craft Beer Segment</span></p></li>
        <li><p class="center"><span class="uppercase underline">Premium bottled water segment</span></p></li>
        <li><p class="center"><span class="uppercase underline">Strong Beer category</span></p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>To build on this success our vision for beverage distribution and enhanced focus includes the initiation of a new (separate) sales and distribution operation focused entirely on beverages. </p>
      <p>Our new facility, centrally located, will increase responsiveness, efficiency, speed and distribution reach. Customers will benefit greatly…and so too will your brands!</p>

      <h3>Commitment</h3>

      <p>The decision to create a new division (internalizing the implied cost structure/burdens) isn’t one made lightly. You do it because you believe. Believe that you can do better:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p class="center uppercase">For Suppliers</p></li>
        <li><p class="center uppercase">For Customers</p></li>
        <li><p class="center uppercase">For Consumers</p></li>

      <p>Today, as a group, we service over 6000 customers in Trinidad & Tobago, segmented both geographically and by account type, we can go broad, deep, or both. This means the right distribution, at the right time, with the right awareness and visibility. Weekly account servicing, planned account management and targeted promotional programs support all we, and our customers, do as we strive to meet consumer demand and build brand affinity. With dedicated facilities, integrated inter-modal logistics and 24 hour response rates our aim is nothing less than to: Delight! This is how we will measure success.      </p>
      <p>Caricom and the disparate geographies of the numerous island nations provide a distinct challenge for many suppliers, and brands. We can simplify this challenge through integrated logistics, direct shipments, cross-docking and affiliated brand management. The simple truth is you’d like to be everywhere but the complications many times out-way the benefits. We understand this. Blessed with an extensive, well-developed and natural port, Trinidad is a perfect transshipment location for much of the Caribbean and South America.      </p>
